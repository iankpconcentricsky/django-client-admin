# Client Admin for Django

Client Admin is an open source project developed by [Concentric Sky](https://concentricsky.com) that enhances Django Admin by providing organization tools and features that make the interface more appropriate for clients. Some of the code started as
  [Admin Tools](https://bitbucket.org/izi/django-admin-tools/overview), although the theming engine has been removed and many features have been added.

- v1.0.11 Various bug fixes and style changes
- v1.0.0 Public codebase was released


## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available on [Read The Docs](http://client-admin-for-django.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).


## Installation

    pip install git+https://github.com/concentricsky/django-client-admin.git

Include Client Admin in your settings.py. It should be listed before the django.contrib.admin module so that client_admin can override the default Django admin templates.

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'client_admin',

        ...

    ]

Include Client Admin urls in your urls.py at the same path as normal contrib.admin

    urlpatterns = patterns('',

        ...

        url(r'^admin/', include('client_admin.urls')),
        url(r'^admin/', include('admin.site.urls')),

        ...

    )


Client Admin depends on Jingo to process Jinja2 templates. Please follow the installation instructions according to that library (available at https://jingo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), and be sure to include contrib.admin in the excluded apps setting:

    JINGO_EXCLUDE_APPS = ( 'admin',)


## Getting Started

### Features
- Provides a new style for the Django Admin interface.
- Provides a dashboard with draggable widgets.
- Creates a menu persistent on all admin pages.
- Provides a system of admin bookmarks that allow users to quickly star favorite pages and have them available from the menu.
- Allows admin templates to extend Jinja2 templates. Assuming certain blocks are present
- Adds an advanced search form to change list views.

### Removed as of 2.0
- Provides a ClientModelAdmin class to inherit from that improves default widgets and settings.
- Provides an additional inline type, Grouped, that acts much like a Stacked inline but floats each field group instead of clearing them.
in your template, this means the admin interface could inherit a header and footer from the front-end templates.
- Provides nested inline formsets for ModelAdmin classes.
- Provides an improved Raw ID foreignkey widget that displays unicode instead of the object's pk.
- Includes revision history and deleted object recovery via django-reversion
